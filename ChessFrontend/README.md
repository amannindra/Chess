Replaced .map with just a for loop with divs. I am trying to make a simple GUI, where when player clicks on character, the background color turns yellow. The previous click, turns back into its original color. It is pretty hard.

No update today. I decided the end this project today because I realized that completing this project while improving my react skils won't help me become a better programmer. I am limiting myself to just react tools. Instead I should be creating projects that use many API's aswell as connect make my project connect to servers. I will continue some other day.
